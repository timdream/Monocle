 This book is aim to showcase the modifications on Monocle
 for the script to render a book in East Asian layout, i.e.:

 * page turns to the right instead of left
 * text is written in vertical, paragraph goes from right to left
   (hance the page turns)

 Current status: INCOMPLETE.

 Keep in mind a INCOMPLETE version does not render book as they should
 look like. If you need a real example, come to Japan, Taiwan, or Hong Kong
 to get a Bunko, or Novel.

 Completed function:

 * Flipper 'slider_right' that turn pages to the right
 * Panels 'twopanel_right' and 'marginal_right' that invert
   the 'zones' of interaction
 * Right-turning book style (style of this book)

 To be done:

 * A Javascript based text layout 'engine' to handle vertical writing
   (since CSS3 text is not yet introduced in any browser)
